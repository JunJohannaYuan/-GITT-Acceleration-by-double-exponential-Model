# -GITT-Acceleration-by-double-exponential-Model
This code repository is the official implementation of the paper "Data-driven acceleration of GITT through physics-informed machine learning" (Yuan et al.). It provides a complete, end-to-end solution for significantly accelerating GITT testing and achieving high-precision simulation of battery dynamic behavior.
